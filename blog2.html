            <h5>UI setup and Gitlab, Feb 9, 2025</h5> <br>

            <p><i>Gitlab management</i></p><br>
            <p>Gitlab seteup is a key part of preparing Wolverinesoft Studio for the upcoming semester. I spent time onboarding
               new members of the team onto our Gitlab, and provided help for anybody who had trouble connecting to our repository.
               I have also spent time verifying and approving Gitlab requests. In between this, I spent time looking into automated
               builds and CI/CD tools.
            </p><br>

            <p><i>UI animations</i></p><br>
            <p>Last week, I worked on UI animations, like button popups, when a building is selected. I familiarized myself with the
               game's UI system in preparation for final UI implementation in the coming weeks. We are using Figma to finalize our UI,
               and have been distributing UI work among programmers. A video of the button animation I coded can be found below:

            </video><br><br>

            <p><i>Notion and planning</i></p><br>
            <p>To create a roadmap for what our team needs to work on, I looked through the Dragonheart game documents to assemble a list of
               features that we need to implement, categorizing each into "target" and "stretch" goals. This was done two weeks ago, as we
               entered the planning phase of development.

            <p><i>Time breakdown</i></p><br>
            <p>I am taking 3 credits of MDP this semester, so I must spend 9 hours a week working on Project Dragonheart. I have
               spent a total of 18 hours doing studio work over the past two weeks. 9 hours from 01/26/25-02/01/25 and 
               9 hours 02/02/25-02/09/25. I spent 4 hours a week in meetings, 2 hours for the Saturday directors meeting 
               and 2 hours for the Sunday all-studio meeting, except for 02/09/25, where I had to miss the all studio-meeting. 
               This leaves 5-7 hours for outside work on the game/project management. ~4 hours a week were spent on Unity,
               experimenting with the UI system , whereas the other ~2 hours a week were spent on management and planning on
               Gitlab and Notion.

            <p><i>Gitlab management</i></p><br>
            <p>More time was spent on Gitlab management these past two weeks, I had to approve, screen, and fix merge requests as they
               were made.
            </p><br>

            <p><i>UI implementation</i></p><br>
            <p>Last week, I worked on UI implementation from the Wolverinesoft Figma. This included building info menus and the party manager.
               The party manager shows the player how much health each of their adventurers have, and the progress they have made on their
               adventures. The info menus are used for building management, and allow the player to see building information, upgrade, or
               delete their building.

            <p><i>Logistics</i></p><br>
            <p>During our directors meeting on 02/22/25, we discussed logistics of implementing a new, more interactive dungeon system.
               We came up with a flowchart to visualize this system for when we implement it in the next few weeks.

            <p>I am taking 3 credits of MDP this semester, so I must spend 9 hours a week working on Project Dragonheart. I have
               spent a total of 18 hours doing studio work over the past two weeks. 9 hours from 02/10/25-02/16/25 and 
               9 hours 02/17/25-02/23/25. I spent 4 hours a week in meetings, 2 hours for the Saturday directors meeting 
               and 2 hours for the Sunday all-studio meeting, except for 02/15/25, where we did not have a directors meeting
               due to the weather. This leaves 5-7 hours for outside work on the game/project management. ~3 hours a week were spent
               on Unity, experimenting with the UI system , whereas the other ~2 hours a week were spent on management and planning on
