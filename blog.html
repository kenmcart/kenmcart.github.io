            <h5>Setup and more, Oct 13, 2024</h5> <br>

            <p><i>Gitlab Setup</i></p><br>
            <p>For these past two weeks, my focus has been primarily on setup for Sandcastle RTS.
               As programming lead, I have been in communication with the EECS departartment to
               set up our own server where we can automate builds and use CI tools from Gitlab.
               This should make the development process smoother and give us access to features
               we would not normally be able to use.</p> <br>

            <p><i>Code familiarization</i></p><br>
            <p>Aside from setting up the Gitlab, I have spent time familiarizing myself with the
               Sandcastle RTS codebase. Wolverinesoft is taking on a game that already has a prototype
               and has implemented basic mechanics. In order to work on this game, I had to understand
               the code architecture. I experimented with the following: <br>
               - Adding my own enemy unit with placeholder asset: the Turtle <br>
               - The day-night cycle (different day/night lengths, time looping) <br>
               - Adjusting properties of player units. <br>
               I also spent time playing through the build and getting familiar with the game from the
               perspective of a player.
            </p><br>

            <p><i>Management</i></p><br>
            <p>Additionally, I spent a lot of time on task management. I assigned the programming team
               onboarding tasks and monitored their progress throughout these past few weeks. I have answered
               questions, added people to the Gitlab, and helped plan for the timeline of Sandcastle RTS.
               I have found these tasks to be especially important in setting the studio up for sucess this semester.
               I do not have a lot of prior management experience, but I am excited to learn how to lead a large team
               of ~13-16 people through as the year progresses.

            <p><i>Time breakdown</i></p><br>
            <p>I am taking 3 credits of MDP this semester, so I must spend 9 hours a week working on Sandcastle RTS. I have
               spent a total of 21 hours doing studio work over the past two weeks. 11 hours from 09/28/24-10/05/24 and 
               10 hours 10/06/24-10/13/24. I spent 4 hours a week on meetings, 2 hours for the Saturday directors meeting 
               and 2 hours for the Sunday all-studio meeting. This leaves 6-7 hours for outside work on the game/project management.
               ~3.5 hours a week were spent on Unity, experimenting with the game, whereas the other ~3 hours a week were spent on
               management and planning.
