            <h5>Setup and more, Oct 13, 2024</h5> <br>

            <p><i>Gitlab Setup</i></p><br>
            <p>For these past two weeks, my focus has been primarily on setup for Sandcastle RTS.
               As programming lead, I have been in communication with the EECS departartment to
               set up our own server where we can automate builds and use CI tools from Gitlab.
               This should make the development process smoother and give us access to features
               we would not normally be able to use.</p> <br>

            <img src="gameplay.png" height="200px" sizealt="Turtle">  <br> <br>

            <p><i>Code familiarization</i></p><br>
            <p>Aside from setting up the Gitlab, I have spent time familiarizing myself with the
               Sandcastle RTS codebase. Wolverinesoft is taking on a game that already has a prototype
               and has implemented basic mechanics. In order to work on this game, I had to understand
               the code architecture. I experimented with the following: <br>
               - Adding my own enemy unit with placeholder asset: the Turtle <br>
               - The day-night cycle (different day/night lengths, time looping) <br>
               - Adjusting properties of player units. <br>
               I also spent time playing through the build and getting familiar with the game from the
               perspective of a player.
            </p><br>

            <p><i>Management</i></p><br>
            <p>Additionally, I spent a lot of time on task management. I assigned the programming team
               onboarding tasks and monitored their progress throughout these past few weeks. I have answered
               questions, added people to the Gitlab, and helped plan for the timeline of Sandcastle RTS.
               I have found these tasks to be especially important in setting the studio up for sucess this semester.
               I do not have a lot of prior management experience, but I am excited to learn how to lead a large team
               of ~13-16 people through as the year progresses.
            </p><br>

            <p><i>Time breakdown</i></p><br>
            <p>I am taking 3 credits of MDP this semester, so I must spend 9 hours a week working on Sandcastle RTS. I have
               spent a total of 21 hours doing studio work over the past two weeks. 11 hours from 09/28/24-10/05/24 and 
               10 hours 10/06/24-10/13/24. I spent 4 hours a week in meetings, 2 hours for the Saturday directors meeting 
               and 2 hours for the Sunday all-studio meeting. This leaves 6-7 hours for outside work on the game/project management.
               ~3.5 hours a week were spent on Unity, experimenting with the game, whereas the other ~3 hours a week were spent on
               management and planning.

            <h5>Gitlab migration and debugging, Oct 25, 2024</h5><br>

            <p><i>Gitlab migration</i></p><br>
            <p>Our team wanted to use CI tools to make development easier, this meant migrating the Wolverinesoft Gitlab to our own server
               that we can run builds from. We have successfully been able to move our team to this new Gitlab and updated everything with
               the old repo's information. I also looked into how we would set up automated builds and other CI tools, and started preparation
               for that. This is where the majority of my time commitment for these past two week has gone.
            </p><br>

            <p><i>Debugging features</i></p><br>
            <p>I also added some debugging feautures like a text clock that keeps track of the in-game day night cycle. This should make
              development easier. This clock easily adjusts to day/night cycle modifications, depending on what has been defined in the game
              parameters. This clock will be revamped to look more visually appealing, but the base mechanics are in for now.
            </p><br>

            <p><i>Animation Rigging</i></p><br>
            <p>I have limited Unity animation experience, but became familiar with the Unity animation rigging system this week. Using the psb importer
              package, I imported the ant enemy art and set up joints and rigging for its animations. <br>
            </p><br>
            <img src="ant.png" height="200px" sizealt="Ant"> <br> <br>

            <p><i>Management</i></p><br>
            <p>Management has taken up a significant amount of my time these past two weeks. I have spent hours answering questions and mantaining the Gitlab.
               My job has included approving and merging pull requests, keeping track of my team's tasks, and checking in on programmers. I have not worked as
               extensively on the game as I normally would have, because most of my tasks have been management-oriented. I have been working on taking feedback
               and using that feedback to develop my skills as a director.
            </p><br>

            <p><i>Time breakdown</i></p><br>
            <p>I am taking 3 credits of MDP this semester, so I must spend 9 hours a week working on Sandcastle RTS. I have
               spent a total of 20 hours doing studio work over the past two weeks. 10 hours from 10/13/24-10/20/24 and 
               10 hours 10/20/24-10/27/24. I spent 4 hours a week in meetings, 2 hours for the Saturday directors meeting 
               and 2 hours for the Sunday all-studio meeting. This means I spent 6 hours on outside work. I spent more time on
               project management this week, with roughly 2.5 hours each week on Gitlab management, 1.5 hours on general managament,
               and 2 hours experimenting with Unity. The clock/debugging tools took one hour to implement, while the animation rigging
               took two hours to figure out. The rest of my time on Unity was spent experimenting with the codebase and project setup.

            <h5>More Gitlab and general management, Nov 10, 2024</h5><br>

            <p><i>Gitlab</i></p><br>
            <p>I continued communication with the Michigan EECS department to get the Gitlab CI automations set up. We ran into a few issues
               with security certification. Progress on this has been slow, as it is difficult to effectively set this up through email communication.
               Once the certification issues are resolved, progress with CI automations should be much faster, as we can set the rest of those up without
               the help of the EECS department.
            </p><br>  

            <p><i>General Management</i></p><br>
              <p>Most of the past two weeks has been dedicated to general management: mantaining the Gitlab repository and making sure that programmer tasks
                 get updated accordingly. Another part of management involved checking in with programmers and making sure they got their tasks done on time.
                 Unfortunately, this means that I do not have a lot to show for my work these past weeks, as it has been almost entirely management-based.
            </p><br>

            <p><i>Repository Issues</i></p><br>
              <p>Because of discrepancies between the old and new repo, some of our programmers were working from different versions of main. Because most of the
                 recent changes were visual- involving shaders and materials- there were lots of merge conflicts when programmers would try to merge their branches
                 into main. This meant that the repositiory had to be monitored so that new branches were properly merged. Programmers had to be aware of these
                 potential issues, which meant I kept in close communication with them throughout these past two weeks.
            </p><br>

            <p><i>Art Implementation</i></p><br>
              <p>In between working on management, I did a little bit of art implementation, experimenting with new sand textures and how they could fit into the game.

            <p><i>Time breakdown</i></p><br>
            <p>I am taking 3 credits of MDP this semester, so I must spend 9 hours a week working on Sandcastle RTS. I have
               spent a total of 18 hours doing studio work over the past two weeks. 9 hours from 10/27/24-11/3/24 and 
               9 hours 11/3/24-11/10/24. I spent 5 hours a week in meetings, 3 hours for the Saturday directors meeting 
               and 2 hours for the Sunday all-studio meeting. This means I spent 4 hours on outside work both weeks. Most of that was
               mantaining the repository, mitigating issues, and working with the EECS department to set up CI tools. Progress
               has been slower due to unforeseen issues, but we have been slowly working through them. About an hour was spent
               experimenting with art implementation. I also spent about two hours resolving merge conflicts and general Gitlab issues
               that came up as a result of the main branch being behind the old repository.

            <h5>Audio implementation and management, Nov 24, 2024</h5><br>

            <p><i>Audio Implementation</i></p><br>
            <p>This most recent week, I worked on audio implementation for the Medium trooper. This meant adding hit and death sound effects to be played in battle.
               I edited the UnitAudioManager to include new audio sources and functions so that I could effectively do this. I also made additions to the audio manager
               prefabs and familizarized myself with the game's audio system.
            </p><br>  

            <p><i>Art Implementation</i></p><br>
            <p>I continued to experiment with art implementation, trying out new sand textures for the game and working with the art director to find a tile set that
               looked best with the game.
            </p><br>

            <p><i>General Management</i></p><br>
            <p>My management tasks these past two weeks involved more communication with the EECS department and managing the repository. I have spent a lot of time making
               sure that branches are merged properly, as well as whether tasks are being completed. I talk to my team members directly to make sure that everything is okay,
               and to help them with merge issues, if necessary.

            <p><i>Time breakdown</i></p><br>
            <p>I am taking 3 credits of MDP this semester, so I must spend 9 hours a week working on Sandcastle RTS. I have
               spent a total of 18 hours doing studio work over the past two weeks. 9 hours from 11/11/24-11/24/24 and 
               11 hours 11/3/24-11/10/24. Over the week of the 11th, I spent 5 hours in meetings, 3 hours for the Saturday directors meeting 
               and 2 hours for the Sunday all-studio meeting. On the following week, I spent 5 hours in the directors meeting which doubled
               as a work session, and I had to miss the weekly Sunday meeting for personal conflicts. This means I spent 4 hours on
               outside work on the week of the 11th, and 6 hours on outside work the following week. Most of that was mantaining the repository
               and audio implementation. Audio implementation took roughly 2 hours.
